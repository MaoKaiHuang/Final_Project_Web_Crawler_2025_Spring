Democracy exists in name alone as uncomfortable levels of surveillance and increasingly fascist policies which claim to protect citizens are clear indicators of a country heading towards dictatorship.\nBut how many actually care, knowing the writing's already on the wall?\nSneaking into techno clubs.

Relentlessly funny & intelligent, with a wonderful young ensemble of actors who all naturally bounce off one another creating a bright group worth following & rooting for with their own fascinating interpersonal dynamics. Kind of surprised Japan didn’t select this for Best International Feature.\nNext Best Picture’s full review here","Likes":153},{"Reviewer":"davidehrlich","Rating":3.5,"Date":"2024-09-28","Content":"Set at a strictly monitored Japanese high school at some point in the near future, Neo Sora’s “Happyend” might be a low-key drama about a group of friends as they steel themselves (and each other) against tomorrow in the weeks before they graduate and scatter to the winds. Yet this coming-of-age story — however pensive and hushed the rest of it might be — begins with an ominous blast of text that wouldn’t be out of place at the start… more","Likes":125},{"Reviewer":"lauren","Rating":5.0,"Date":"2024-10-08","Content":"so there’s this really beautiful movie …. that i saw earlier today …. and i loved everything about it so much that i don’t even really want to put it into words i just want to cherish it….and well? this is that movie.","Likes":115},{"Reviewer":"DamRibeiro","Rating":4.0,"Date":"2025-04-13","Content":"Muitas coisas acontecem antes de nos tornarmos quem somos, nossa identidade, sonhos, desejos e sentimentos vão sendo moldados conforme nossa personalidade vai se formando, mas, antes que essas marcas se firmem, passamos por um longo e delicado processo de descoberta, a juventude se torna esse grande palco para os papéis que talvez, um dia, venhamos a assumir por completo. Happyend desenha muito bem, em seus personagens jovens, todas essas questões e camadas, à primeira vista, as principais características são ensaios… more","Likes":83},{"Reviewer":"Jaime Rebanal 🇵🇸","Rating":4.5,"Date":"2024-09-08","Content":"TIFF 2024 #24: Centrepiece (North American Premiere)\nIt feels as if this movie was built out of a (completely justified) anger towards Japan's government under the presidency of Shinzo Abe. But this movie also builds itself off how teenagers begin to find themselves forming a revolution, especially after an innocent prank ends up resulting in the enforcement of hugely authoritarian practices that do not treat these young students as human beings. Yet that's also part of what made Happyend resonate,… more","Likes":84},{"Reviewer":"sakana1","Rating":3.5,"Date":"2025-05-10","Content":"Happyend is set in a pre-apocalyptic, near-future Tokyo, but neither the location nor the time really matter to the story. What matters is how it feels to grow up: to make new friends, keep others, and leave some behind; to realize what you will fight for; to dare to look beyond the edges of your own life. To consider the future as a real, concrete thing for the first time.\nHurtling toward a looming future as they prepare to graduate… more","Likes":54},{"Reviewer":"KYK","Rating":3.5,"Date":"2024-09-20","Content":"Set in a near future that feels basically present day, a coming-of-age tale where the feeling of being a teen outcast is deepened by the sense of not belonging in your own country, whether you’re zainichi korean or enraged at the political systems that make it up.","Likes":70},{"Reviewer":"Dakota Arsenault","Rating":3.5,"Date":"2024-09-28","Content":"When does the boilerroom set of the DJ drop?","Likes":72},{"Reviewer":"Realkinoshit","Rating":4.0,"Date":"2025-04-16","Content":"🇯🇵 social credit +1000000000\nNeo Sora’s Happyend is beautiful but also creepy as hell. On the surface it feels like a coming-of-age story, but underneath it’s full dystopian vibes.\nThe way the school turns into a surveillance prison hits different, especially now when literally everything’s being watched — cameras, phones, internet and more.
