demi adejuyigbe,,2022-02-21,"my therapist likes to stop me whenever i criticize myself with the word ‘should,' that i should feel some way, that i should have done something. we stop and dig into this statement until i get to the root of it and try to understand how i've internalized whatever idea or feeling or action is meant to be ""correct"" or ""normal."" it's a hard thing for me to do because it's always easiest to lightly lean on myself as the… more",8633
Patrick Willems,4.5,2022-01-03,I know there’s way more important stuff here but I have to point out that the 2-door red Saab is one of the best movie cars I’ve ever seen. Just a truly excellent car. Lots of character.,7387

""It's fabulous. The movie paced so smoothly, I hardly feel the runtime. I even forgot I'm watching a movie. I've watched many movies, but it's never been so pleasant.""",2204
