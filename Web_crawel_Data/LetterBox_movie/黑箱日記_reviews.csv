André Grochovski,4,2025-02-03,"We always think of Japan as such an advanced country, and it is. But we don't realize how archaic they are in other aspects, such as how to approach sexual crimes.

Shiori Itō takes it upon herself to investigate her own sexual assault by a high ranking government official, when the police (and essentially everyone else) are eager to dismiss her account. An investigative journalist by trade it’s fascinating to watch her process her own case at times as if she is external to the facts and circumstances, yet at other times you witness the gravity of her ordeal really hit her. Very similar in a lot of ways to… more",276

Após a conversa, ela alega ter sido drogada e levada contra sua vontade ao quarto de hotel dele, onde foi estuprada enquanto estava inconsciente.

Daniel,4.5,2025-02-25,"""The typical expectation of a victim is to be sad and weak, to hide and be embarrassed. I had a problem with this norm.""
In 2015, journalist Shiori Itō became a victim of sexual assault. The police ended their investigation since Japanese laws make prosecuting sex crimes difficult, and because her rapist is a high profile journalist with connections to the prime minister. In 2017, Itō decides to go public to force another investigation and change public discourse ...

After you experience her story, as personal as documentaries get, you will too. 
A heartbreaking triumph.",149
Matt Neglia,4,2024-01-27,"BLACK BOX DIARIES is a daring & courageous feat of investigative journalism by Shiori Itō, looking into her own experience of sexual assault & the tenacious quest for truth within Japan's corrupt & archaic legal system. This profoundly personal account unfolds with gripping power, utilizing journal entries, riveting & infuriating twists, all presented in chronological order over several years to highlight the taxing toll this all took on her. But, as a result, her resilience shines through and it’s inspiring to witness. A harrowing but important & impactful film.",137
