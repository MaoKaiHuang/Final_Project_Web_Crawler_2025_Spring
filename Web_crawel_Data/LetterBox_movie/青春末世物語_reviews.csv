Ayush,4.5,2025-05-06,"Teenage wasteland in the prologue to the end of the world.
The door to a dystopian future has been knocked clean; they are living it. Democracy exists in name alone as uncomfortable levels of surveillance and increasingly fascist policies which claim to protect citizens are clear indicators of a country heading towards dictatorship.
But how many actually care, knowing the writing's already on the wall?

Matt Neglia,4,2024-09-20,"Much like the impending earthquakes threatening to upend civilian life in modern-day Japan, the rebellious high school students of HAPPYEND are just as disruptive as they shake the very foundations of authority, ridiculing oppressive laws & constant surveillance, asserting themselves as the true voices of their generation. Relentlessly funny & intelligent, with a wonderful young ensemble of actors who all naturally bounce off one another creating a bright group worth following & rooting for with their own fascinating interpersonal dynamics. Kind of surprised Japan didn’t select this for Best International Feature.

davidehrlich,3.5,2024-09-28,"Set at a strictly monitored Japanese high school at some point in the near future, Neo Sora’s “Happyend” might be a low-key drama about a group of friends as they steel themselves (and each other) against tomorrow in the weeks before they graduate and scatter to the winds. Yet this coming-of-age story — however pensive and hushed the rest of it might be — begins with an ominous blast of text that wouldn’t be out of place at the start… more",125

DamRibeiro,4,2025-04-13,"Muitas coisas acontecem antes de nos tornarmos quem somos, nossa identidade, sonhos, desejos e sentimentos vão sendo moldados conforme nossa personalidade vai se formando, mas, antes que essas marcas se firmem, passamos por um longo e delicado processo de descoberta, a juventude se torna esse grande palco para os papéis que talvez, um dia, venhamos a assumir por completo. Happyend desenha muito bem, em seus personagens jovens, todas essas questões e camadas, à primeira vista, as principais características são ensaios… more",83
Jaime Rebanal 🇵🇸,4.5,2024-09-08,"TIFF 2024 #24: Centrepiece (North American Premiere)
It feels as if this movie was built out of a (completely justified) anger towards Japan's government under the presidency of Shinzo Abe. But this movie also builds itself off how teenagers begin to find themselves forming a revolution, especially after an innocent prank ends up resulting in the enforcement of hugely authoritarian practices that do not treat these young students as human beings. Yet that's also part of what made Happyend resonate,… more",84
sakana1,3.5,2025-05-10,"Happyend is set in a pre-apocalyptic, near-future Tokyo, but neither the location nor the time really matter to the story. What matters is how it feels to grow up: to make new friends, keep others, and leave some behind; to realize what you will fight for; to dare to look beyond the edges of your own life. To consider the future as a real, concrete thing for the first time.
Hurtling toward a looming future as they prepare to graduate… more",54
KYK,3.5,2024-09-20,"Set in a near future that feels basically present day, a coming-of-age tale where the feeling of being a teen outcast is deepened by the sense of not belonging in your own country, whether you’re zainichi korean or enraged at the political systems that make it up.",70

Neo Sora’s Happyend is beautiful but also creepy as hell. On the surface it feels like a coming-of-age story, but underneath it’s full dystopian vibes.
The way the school turns into a surveillance prison hits different, especially now when literally everything’s being watched — cameras, phones, internet and more. It’s like, you think you’re free but nah, Big Brother’s right there.
What makes Happyend so good is how it shows the characters dealing with their own… more",70
Ryo Shen,4.5,2024-11-19,"「你有在認真思考嗎？」
片中的學生都有各自的迷惘，對身份認同的掙扎。有人為了永住證忍耐過日子，日本人在享有一切福利的狀態下為「外人」爭取權力。政治議題在日本校園竟然可以如此融入，毫無違和感。身為韓國二代的幸看似有在思考，但他身為韓裔的原罪讓他憤怒又無可奈何。他在片中其實是最不知道自己在幹嘛的人。
悠太看似及時行樂，無憂無慮，但我覺得他才是最清楚世界運作方式的角色。他是「最純正」的日本人，也明白示威抗議是沒用的。他應該是片中代表日本年輕人的符號：麻木、不關心社會、只在乎自己開不開心。
小明對自己喪失母語的羞愧對比日本流暢卻要回去美國的湯姆也很有趣，「語言」雖然重要，但對正值青春年華的他們來說，有朋友的支持比任何事物都還要來得深刻。我想，未來他們回想起高中這段時光的時候，印象最深的絕對不是對社會、對體制的憤怒；而是一起在校長辦公室靜坐的夥伴、畢業典禮時穿著嘲笑校長的外套做一些小反抗的回憶吧。
這部片的節奏、故事非常乾淨，音樂品味非常對我的胃口。電影有幾幕夜晚的場景甚至有三宅唱的影子，頭和結尾相互對照呼應，「我愛你！」和無言以對編排的很巧妙甚至充滿靈氣。今天能有幸跟坂本龍一的導演兒子合影非常開心，期待他未來的作品。
另，聽完導演的映後分享我覺得他是個很溫柔的人。電影其實可以看出他的個性，比如他說地震時他選擇用無聲呈現的很大原因是他擔心日本人在經歷大地震後，聽到地震聲會產生PTSD。他建造一個左派烏托邦，讓故事裡的孩子自己衝撞體制、思考，學著對人生負責，或許這也是導演對未來的希望吧。",71
