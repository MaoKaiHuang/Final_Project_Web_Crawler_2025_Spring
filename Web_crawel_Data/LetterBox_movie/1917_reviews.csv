IHE,3.5,2020-01-10,"Got milk?
A fairly simple ‘boots on the ground’ WW1 story elevated by exceptional blocking, (Deakins) camerawork, set design and overall polish. Sags a little in the last third and the music can be too schmaltzy at times (a problem I’ve had with Thomas Newman in the past). Overall I’d say it’s worth a watch, it’s a grounded perspective that helps give a feel for how ruthless and terrifying the conflict was.",2764
